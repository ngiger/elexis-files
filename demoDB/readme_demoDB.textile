Uses of demoDB:

1) You may install the demoDB from the installer.jar. There nobody has admin or mandanten rights. 
   (KISS, Keep It Simple, Stupid) This should be okay for all beginners,
   
2) demoDB_2.1.7_with_mandant.zip. Download and unzip this file into your installation and you have some more rights if you log in as test with password test.

3) demoDB_2_1_7_mit_Administrator.zip. Download and unzip this file into your installation and you have all rights if you log in as Administrator and password admin
